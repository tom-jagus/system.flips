# Project Ideation Summary

## üß† Initial Concept

The core idea is to design a structured, repeatable, and manual-first email management methodology based on the principle that the inbox is a _fleeting folder_. All emails should be triaged immediately and sorted into clearly defined, purpose-built folders or deleted. This evolved from a personal pain point of chronically cluttered inboxes in both work and personal email accounts, and developed into a generalized system for long-term inbox hygiene.

This approach is formalized under the acronym **F.L.I.P.S.**: _Fleeting Logic for Inbox Processing System_.

---

## üö© Problem Statements

- Inbox overload from years of untriaged emails
- Important messages getting lost in noise
- Inconsistent folder systems and no personal standard
- Lack of structured rules or review routines
- Avoidance of automation due to fear of missing critical info

---

## üßπ Potential Components

- **Named Folder Structure** using numeric prefixes for sorting and intentional processing
- **Manual Triage Flow** using Inbox as a temporary holding zone
- **Behavior-Based Ruleset** for how and when to use each folder
- **System Setup Guide** for configuring Outlook and Gmail
- **Native Automation** suggestions (e.g., folder review nudges via rules/flags)

---

## üîó Related Systems / Tools

- Works with any IMAP-compatible email client
- Native rule systems in Outlook and Gmail
- Based on ideas from GTD, PARA, and Zero Inbox principles
- No scripting, API use, or external automation required

---

## üöÄ Potential Use Cases

- Personal and professional inbox cleanup and maintenance
- Adoption by team members for consistent inbox flow
- Adaptation as part of onboarding documentation
- Use in training workshops or personal productivity audits

---

## üí° Opportunities

- Can be shared as a public methodology or internal SOP
- Forms a foundation for future micro-automation (if desired)
- Easy to scale or customize per role or email volume
- Could be integrated into broader personal systems thinking (Obsidian, Notion, etc.)

---

## ‚ùì Concerns / Unknowns

- Discipline required to maintain a manual triage habit
- Folder count could become overwhelming if over-customized
- Some naming may require adjustment depending on corporate context
- Review automation might be limited by email client capabilities

---

## üìç Milestones

1. [ ] Initialize the project repository and folder structure (GitHub, README, docs)
2. [ ] Define and document universal folder names for categories
3. [ ] Define and document triage flow and folder usage rules
4. [ ] Write a universal system setup guide for Outlook and Gmail
5. [ ] Define, test, and document native review notifications (mailbox rule-based reminders)
6. [ ] Review for improvement and consider future expansion scope
7. [ ] Finalize v1.0 as internal SOP or public documentation

## ‚úÖ Decision

- [x] Promote to project ‚Äì This idea is ready to be formalized into a tracked project.

---

## üìÇ Notes

- Work and personal structures share a core folder set:
  - `00_Important`, `01_Action`, `02_Reply`, `03_Review`, `04_Meetings`, `05_Events`, `99_Reference`
- Personal expands with: `06_Shopping`, `07_Bills`, `08_Finance`, `09_Services`
- Inbox is always temporary; no "@To Process" needed
- No "Archive", "Waiting", or people-based folders
- Naming is intentional and numerically ordered for quick access
- Project explicitly excludes scripting, APIs, templates, or third-party integrations
