# 🔄 Triage Process & Folder Logic – F.L.I.P.S.

This document defines the official triage process for handling incoming email using the **F.L.I.P.S.** system.  
It aligns with the principle that the inbox is a _fleeting folder_ — a temporary zone where each message must be either discarded or routed immediately based on intent.

---

## 🧭 Philosophy: Inbox as a Fleeting Zone

The inbox is **not** a workspace or a holding tank.  
It is a **temporary entry point**, meant to be emptied regularly — ideally immediately.

Triage is triggered **as soon as new messages arrive**, not at arbitrary review times.  
Each visible message must be either **deleted or sorted**, right away.

### ⏱️ Why Immediate Triage Matters

Delaying triage allows messages to accumulate, which leads to:

- Cognitive overload from a crowded inbox
- Higher chance of overlooking time-sensitive requests
- Slower processing due to decision fatigue
- Shift from micro-decisions (seconds) to bulky sessions (minutes)

💡 Triage should be fast and nearly frictionless — tackling 1–2 emails on arrival is quicker, cleaner, and maintains clarity throughout the day.

## 📥 Triage Flow Overview

```
Start
 ↓
New Email Arrives
 ↓
Is message irrelevant?
 └─ Yes → 🗑️ Delete
 ↓
Is an action required?
 ├─ Reply needed → 📂 02_Reply
 ├─ Task required → 📂 01_Action
 ↓
Is attention or awareness required?
 ├─ Track/monitor → 📂 00_Important
 ├─ Read/understand later → 📂 03_Review
 ↓
Is it tied to time or events?
 ├─ Calendar invite → 📂 04_Meetings
 ├─ Travel/conference/event → 📂 05_Events
 ↓
Is it informational only?
 └─ Needs to be retained → 📂 99_Reference
```

## 🧩 Triage Steps (Manual Routine)

### 🔹 Step 1: Monitor for New Messages

- Triage is triggered **whenever new email arrives**, or at the start of each work session
- The goal is to process each message immediately, keeping the inbox consistently empty

### 🔹 Step 2: One-by-One Processing

For each email:

1. **Delete if irrelevant**

   - Marketing, spam, duplicates, FYIs without value

2. **Determine behavioral outcome**  
   Ask: _What is required of me next?_

3. **Move to correct folder**  
   Use the folder logic chart below

## 📂 Folder Logic Chart

| Folder         | Use When...                                                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `00_Important` | You must monitor this — critical, escalated, or high-stakes visibility       |
| `01_Action`    | A task must be performed (excluding replies)                                 |
| `02_Reply`     | A reply is required or the thread is being tracked for future responses      |
| `03_Review`    | You must read or analyze the content later (not time-bound)                  |
| `04_Meetings`  | Email relates to a scheduled call or meeting                                 |
| `05_Events`    | Email involves an upcoming real-world event, trip, or non-routine occurrence |
| `99_Reference` | Email includes information or files worth keeping for future use             |

📌 _If multiple folders could apply, select the one that best reflects the **next expected behavior**._

## 🔍 Routing Examples

- A follow-up request asking for document edits → `01_Action`
- A vendor sends a question that needs a response → `02_Reply`
- A policy change announcement you’ll read later → `03_Review`
- A Zoom invite with agenda → `04_Meetings`
- A hotel booking confirmation → `05_Events`
- An email with a downloadable slide deck for future reference → `99_Reference`
- An urgent operations update marked high priority → `00_Important`

---

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Never leave emails sitting in the inbox “just in case”
- Don’t create ad hoc folders by topic, project, or person
- Avoid duplicating folders for the same intent (e.g., don’t split meetings by client)

---

## 📌 Summary

F.L.I.P.S. triage is designed for clarity, decisiveness, and speed.  
By treating the inbox as a temporary buffer and routing messages by behavioral outcome, users can maintain focus, reclaim inbox control, and reduce cognitive overhead.
