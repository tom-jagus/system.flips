# 🔄 Triage Process & Folder Logic – F.L.I.P.S.

This document defines the official triage process for handling incoming email using the **F.L.I.P.S.** system.  
It aligns with the principle that the inbox is a _fleeting folder_ — a temporary zone where each message must be either discarded or routed immediately based on intent.

## 🧭 Philosophy: Inbox as a Fleeting Zone

The inbox is **not** a workspace or a holding tank.  
It is a **temporary entry point**, meant to be emptied regularly — ideally immediately.

Triage is triggered **as soon as new messages arrive**, not at arbitrary review times.  
Each visible message must be either **deleted or sorted**, right away.

### ⏱️ Why Immediate Triage Matters

Delaying triage allows messages to accumulate, which leads to:

- Cognitive overload from a crowded inbox
- Higher chance of overlooking time-sensitive requests
- Slower processing due to decision fatigue
- Shift from micro-decisions (seconds) to bulky sessions (minutes)

💡 Triage should be fast and nearly frictionless — tackling 1–2 emails on arrival is quicker, cleaner, and maintains clarity throughout the day.

## 📥 Triage Flow Overview

```
Start
 ↓
New Email Arrives
 ↓
Is message irrelevant?
 └─ Yes → 🗑️ Delete
 ↓
Is an action required?
 ├─ Reply needed → 📂 02_Reply
 ├─ Task required → 📂 01_Action
 ↓
Is attention or awareness required?
 ├─ Track/monitor → 📂 00_Important
 ├─ Read/understand later → 📂 03_Review
 ↓
Is it tied to time or events?
 ├─ Calendar invite → 📂 04_Meetings
 ├─ Travel/conference/event → 📂 05_Events
 ↓
Is it informational only?
 └─ Needs to be retained → 📂 99_Reference
```

## 🧩 Triage Steps (Manual Routine)

### 🔹 Step 1: Monitor for New Messages

- Triage is triggered **whenever new email arrives**, or at the start of each work session
- The goal is to process each message immediately, keeping the inbox consistently empty

### 🔹 Step 2: One-by-One Processing

For each email:

1. **Delete if irrelevant**

   - Marketing, spam, duplicates, FYIs without value

2. **Determine behavioral outcome**  
   Ask: _What is required of me next?_

3. **Move to correct folder**  
   Use the folder logic chart below

## 📂 Folder Logic Chart

| Folder         | Use When...                                                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `00_Important` | The message needs short-term visibility due to urgency or strategic impact  |
| `01_Action`    | A task must be performed (excluding replies)                                |
| `02_Reply`     | A reply is required, or you're waiting on someone else                      |
| `03_Review`    | The content should be read or considered later (not time-sensitive)         |
| `04_Meetings`  | The message relates to a scheduled meeting, agenda, or invite               |
| `05_Events`    | The email involves events, travel, or non-routine calendar items            |
| `90_Reference` | The content is reusable (attachments, templates, credentials, etc.)         |
| `97_Knowledge` | The content contains reusable insights or informal documentation            |
| `98_Legacy`    | It’s long-past work of enduring relevance (e.g., past project email chains) |
| `99_Archive`   | It’s emotionally or historically valuable and worth preserving              |

📌 _If multiple folders apply, choose the one that reflects the **next required behavior or purpose**. Prioritize action over reference._

## 🔍 Routing Examples

- A follow-up request asking for document edits → `01_Action`
- A vendor sends a question that needs a response → `02_Reply`
- A policy change announcement you’ll read later → `03_Review`
- A Zoom invite with agenda → `04_Meetings`
- A hotel booking confirmation → `05_Events`
- An email with a reusable slide deck or resource file → `90_Reference`
- A thoughtful explanation about how to handle a complex process → `97_Knowledge`
- A completed project’s final wrap-up thread or client sign-off → `98_Legacy`
- A farewell message from a longtime colleague → `99_Archive`
- An urgent operations update marked high priority → `00_Important`

---

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Never leave emails sitting in the inbox “just in case”
- Don’t create ad hoc folders by topic, project, or person
- Avoid duplicating folders for the same intent (e.g., don’t split meetings by client)

## 📌 Summary

F.L.I.P.S. triage is designed for clarity, decisiveness, and speed.  
By treating the inbox as a temporary buffer and routing messages by behavioral outcome, users can maintain focus, reclaim inbox control, and reduce cognitive overhead.
