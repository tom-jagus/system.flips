# 📁 Folder Structure – F.L.I.P.S.

This document defines the universal folder naming conventions and philosophy used in the F.L.I.P.S. system.  
The folder structure is designed to optimize clarity, triage speed, and long-term inbox hygiene across both personal and professional email accounts.

---

## 🎯 Naming Philosophy

Folders are **purpose-built** and use **numeric prefixes** to:

- Enforce **visual order** and **processing priority** across clients
- Enable quick access with keyboard shortcuts or mobile views
- Reflect **behavioral intent**, not topic or sender

### ❓ Why this way?

- You shouldn't have to think _where_ an email goes — the structure answers that
- Behavioral folders reduce overthinking and categorization fatigue
- Numeric prefixes make folders appear in the same order across platforms
- Flat structure prevents hidden decisions — every folder is visible and accountable

## 📌 Core Folder Set (Work & Personal)

These folders form the baseline for triage and active processing:

| Folder Name    | Purpose                                                              | Example                                                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `00_Important` | High-priority messages requiring awareness or tracking               | Critical announcements, escalation notices                |
| `01_Action`    | Emails requiring a non-reply action or follow-up task                | Request to update a report, task handoff, approval needed |
| `02_Reply`     | Messages that require a written or verbal response                   | Customer question, stakeholder feedback, vendor inquiry   |
| `03_Review`    | To be reviewed when time allows (reading, decisions, quiet catch-up) | Article to read, product doc, business proposal           |
| `04_Meetings`  | Invites, agendas, minutes, and coordination for scheduled meetings   | Weekly sync invite, agenda doc, Zoom link                 |
| `05_Events`    | Event-related materials (webinars, trainings, conferences)           | Conference registration, session info, travel details     |

## 🏡 Optional Personal-Use Folders

These folders are for users managing mixed (personal + work) accounts or heavy personal email volume.

| Folder Name   | Purpose                                                            | Example                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `06_Shopping` | Order confirmations, delivery updates, promotional purchases       | Amazon receipt, shipping notification                    |
| `07_Bills`    | Payment reminders, receipts, utility invoices                      | Electricity bill, phone plan invoice                     |
| `08_Finance`  | Banking, investments, credit updates                               | Monthly statement, tax document, investment update       |
| `09_Services` | Subscriptions, insurance, repairs, personal services communication | Netflix renewal, car insurance docs, dentist appointment |

Only create these if they match your volume and lifestyle — otherwise, keep it lean.

## 🧱 High-Index Preservation Block

This block is for **non-triaged**, **value-retaining** messages that are explicitly preserved.  
They are not part of the active flow and should rarely be reviewed unless intentionally revisited.

| Folder Name    | Purpose                                                                      | Example                                                         |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `97_Knowledge` | Emails with valuable content or potential for reuse and insight mining       | Long advice threads, workflows, process explanations            |
| `98_Legacy`    | Historical work/project correspondence of long-term relevance                | Old job correspondence, completed projects, migration histories |
| `99_Archive`   | Permanent storage of personal, emotional, or historically significant emails | Family messages, farewell emails, memories from early years     |

These folders allow clarity **without hiding anything** — they’re visible, named, and justified.

---

## 🚫 Prohibited Folder Types

To preserve clarity and prevent decision fatigue, avoid:

- `@To Process` – Inbox **is** the triage zone
- `Archive` (default client archive) – Use `99_Archive` with intention
- People-based folders (e.g., “John”, “HR”) – Redundant and messy
- Topic folders (e.g., “Projects”, “Finance”) – Already represented behaviorally

No custom folders should be added unless explicitly defined here.

## 🗃️ Folder Creation Tips

- Create folders in **desktop email client** for better control and sort order
- Use color categories/tags (if supported) for speed without complexity
- Stick to flat hierarchy — **no nesting allowed** for transparency and clarity

---

## 🔁 Triage Decision Tips

If a message fits multiple folders:

- Ask: _What is the next action required?_
  - Needs a reply? → `02_Reply`
  - Needs to be done? → `01_Action`
  - Might be useful someday? → `97_Knowledge` or `90_Reference`
- When in doubt, favor **action** over **reference**
- If no action or value, delete it — not everything deserves a home

## 🧭 Summary

F.L.I.P.S. defines a clean, stable, and purpose-built folder set to guide both action and preservation.  
With numeric prefixes, a closed folder system, and behavior-first logic, it enables maintainable inbox hygiene across platforms, use cases, and roles — whether for daily work or lifelong correspondence.
