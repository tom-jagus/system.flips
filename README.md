# 📨 F.L.I.P.S. – Fleeting Logic for Inbox Processing System

**F.L.I.P.S.** is a structured, manual-first email management methodology designed to bring order, clarity, and long-term hygiene to your inbox.  
It operates on the principle that the inbox is a _fleeting folder_ — not a place for storage, but a space for triage.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This repository serves as the canonical documentation for the F.L.I.P.S. system.  
It provides folder structures, behavioral rules, setup guides, and usage principles for both work and personal email accounts.

F.L.I.P.S. is:

- Client-agnostic (works with Outlook, Gmail, or any IMAP-compatible client)
- Automation-optional (native features only; no scripting or APIs)
- Based on habits, not hacks

## 📌 Key Principles

- The Inbox is temporary: triage, sort, or delete
- Folders are purpose-built with clear, behavior-driven intent
- Naming uses numeric prefixes for speed and focus
- Manual rules first; automation only if needed and native
- Designed for sustainable, repeatable inbox hygiene
